# RoboLab-WS1415-TUD

This repository houses the RoboLab project for the course RoboLab at TU Dresden and was created by **Felix Wittwer, Steffi Macak, Tim Stelzig** and **Max Ulitzka** (Group 7, 16.03.2015 - 28.03.2015).

## Setting up the Workspaces

If you want to use the Source Code provided in this repo on your NXT, follow these Steps:

1. Git-clone the repo

2. If you have not already, install the `Eclipse IDE for C/C++` (can be found [here](http://www.eclipse.org)) on your computer along with the additional packages and drivers, provided on https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1g4fsap2re78npf/AAA6sP436yRCfl63jRXyvyo8a inside the HowTo-File.

3. Download the Eclipse-Workspace for the Robot from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1g4fsap2re78npf/AAAIDFSSb8KU26nl98dBy6_oa/workspace_robot.zip.

4. Extract the files from the archive and copy them into the Robot-Workspace, rename the folder *example* to *RoboLab* (you can delete the cloned *RoboLab*-folder). You now have to pull some files again.

5. Enjoy! You can now pull any update easily, this should not cause any trouble with the workspace and the path to the includes.
